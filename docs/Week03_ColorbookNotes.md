# Colorbook Notes

### Accessibility

* Print, Save, Share buttons are a bit too thin from a first glance, might want to bold them to increase readability (will look at this in future testings)

### Questions from testing

* Is “View Gallery” a link to the home page or is a pagination to view different images? Will my current image be saved or deleted?
* Gallery scrollbar might be unnecessary
* Will the color picker be in the way of the image when in mobile? This isn’t optimal, would rather have it on the bottom of the page, not in a overlay of the image (this will prevent the user from clicking on the image and filling something in by accident)
* Will the icons like erase, clear be filled in once clicked on? How do I know I am in erase mode


### Design suggestions
 
* Allow for the user to send a link to someone a custom drawing and page layout will be sent to the user 
*  Give the user an option to expand the image and black out the background to increase contrast so they can see the details of the image            

### Good Points
* Text is big and legible for most of the UI
* Art direction is good, has a nice sketchbook feel.
